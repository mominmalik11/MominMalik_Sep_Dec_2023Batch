	//Data Structure - a way to store data in the memory in an efficient way
	//efficient means - time and space complexities
	
	//Java has 8 primitive data types and we can store data in a very simple fashion
	
	public static void main(String args[]) {
		
		int a = 1;
		char c = 'a';
		boolean b = true;
	}
	
	//Data structure is basically divided into 2 types
	//1 Primitive DS
	//2 Non Primitive DS
	
	//Non Primitive DS is further divided into 2 types
	//1 Linear DS - String,Arrays,List,Set,Queue, ArrayList LinkedList, HashSet, LinkedHashSet, etc
	//2 Non-Linear DS - Graph and Trees
	
	//Difference between primitive and non primitive DS
	
	//Difference 1 - Primitive DS cannot hold multiple data
	public static void primitiveDS() {
		char c1 = 'a'; // cannot store more than one data type
		String S1 = "abcdefghi"; // can store multiple data type
		int [] arr = {1,2,3,4,5,6};// can store multiple data type, int cannot do this
	
	}
	
	//Difference 2 - Primiitive DS can be used to write simple programs (calculator, snakegame, Curency Converter) but non primitive DS can be used to write
	// large scale applications such as E-Commerce, Social Networking, Banking etc
	//Algorithms need very strong data back up
	
	//Reason - collection framework is part of non primitive DS and it is nothing but a pre defined API (Application Programming Interface)

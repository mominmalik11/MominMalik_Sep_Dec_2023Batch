	// it is the blueprint of a class. It tells it what to do, but not how to do it
	//methods inside the interfane are abstract and public
	//variables are final, static, and public 
	//from jdk8 default concrete methods were allowed
	//from jdk9 private concrete methods were allowed
	//from jdk8 static concrete methods were allowed
	
	//a concrete class (regular/simple/normal) Class which implements the interface is knownn as the implenting Class of that Interface
	//one concrete class can implement mulitple interfaces - this is the only place where mulitple inhertance is allowed in java
	//when a concrete class implements an interface, it also has to implement all the abstract methods of the interface
	//a concrete Class can extend an Abstract Class as well as implement an interface or implement mulitple interfaces

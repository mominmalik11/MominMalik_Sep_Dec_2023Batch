	//OOPs- Object Oriented Programming System or Structure
	//It is a programming pradigm [ways of doing programming]
		//procedural programming
		//functional programming
		//Logical programming
		//Structural programming
	//OOps in java has 6 pillars
	//1 class and object
	//2 methods
	//3 inheritance
	//4 polymorphism
	//5 abstraction [abstract class and interface]
	//6 encapsulation 
	
	//Let us understand Class
	//if you consider Java, broadly Classes are defined into two types:
		//Pre-Defined classes
		//User-Defined classes
	
	//What is the problem if a user tries to replicate the same name of the Class which is already pre-defined?
	//Note: do not create user defined class which is equivalent to pre-defined class in Java. if you do this then the compiler will get confused
	
	//What is a class?
	//it is a blueprint or a template which allows you to convey your logic
	//it represents a set of properties that are common to all objects of one type
	//Class does not occupy memory, it is not a physical entity it is a logical entity 
	// Collection of Objects, Methods, Constructors,Variables,Blocks,NestedClass etc
	
	//example Road- road is a Class which gives you a platform to drive your car. The car is the object, a bus is an object, trucks etc
	
	//What are the access modifiers used for a Class?
	//public
	//private
	//protected
	//default
	// You cannot use private and protected to define a class
	
	
	public  understandingObjects() {
		// this is a nested class
		// you cant make this a public class because the first class on top is public, nested class must be defualt
	}
	
	public static void main(String[]args) {
		
		System.out.println("hello world"); //syso is a predefined class
		
		
		
		
	}
	
		
	}
